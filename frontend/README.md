# Full Stack Blog Application - MERN Stack

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Additionally, it integrates AI functionality to generate blog post summaries using OpenAI's GPT-3.

## Features
- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** functionality for blog posts.
- **AI-powered summary generation** for new blog posts using OpenAI's GPT-3 API.
- **Responsive and animated frontend** built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Routing** implemented using React Router DOM with a fixed top navbar and dynamic content area.
- **Toast notifications** for user actions like post creation, update, and deletion using `react-toastify`.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Vite
  - Tailwind CSS
  - React Router DOM
  - React Toastify
  - Axios (for API calls)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (with Mongoose for data modeling)
  - OpenAI GPT-3 (for AI-based summary generation)
  - REST API (CRUD operations)

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-blog-app.git
   cd fullstack-blog-app
   cd client
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd server
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the server directory with the following content:

makefile
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 and the backend will run on http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
POST /posts: Create a new blog post.
GET /posts: Retrieve all blog posts.
GET /posts/:id: Retrieve details of a specific blog post.
PUT /posts/:id: Update a specific blog post.
DELETE /posts/:id: Delete a specific blog post.
Frontend Components
Home Page: Displays a list of all blog posts with titles and summaries.
Post Page: Displays the full content of a blog post with options to edit or delete it.
Create Page: A form to create a new blog post with a summary generated by AI.
Edit Page: A form to update an existing blog post.
AI Integration
The AI-powered summary generation is implemented using OpenAI's GPT-3 API.
The summary is automatically generated when creating a new blog post and displayed on the Post Page.
Toast Notifications
React Toastify is used for displaying success or error notifications for various actions, such as creating, updating, or deleting blog posts.
Testing and Deployment
Testing
Ensure that the frontend and backend servers are running.
Test all CRUD operations for the blog posts.
Verify AI summary generation functionality.
Deployment
The application can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS for both frontend and backend.
Make sure to configure environment variables for MongoDB and OpenAI API in the production environment.
Future Enhancements
Implement user authentication for blog post ownership.
Add features like tagging, categorization, and searching for blog posts.
Improve AI summarization with custom models for better accuracy.
